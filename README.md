## Installation

1. **Install a userscript manager**:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

2. **Install the userscript**:
   - **Option A (Direct install with auto-updates)**: 
     - [Click here to install](https://github.com/KleinerCodeDrago/TwitterToDiscordWebhook/raw/refs/heads/master/twitter-to-discord.user.js)
     - Your userscript manager will prompt you to install
     - The script will automatically check for updates
   - **Option B (Manual install)**:
     - Open `twitter-to-discord.user.js` in your browser
     - Click "Install" when prompted by your userscript manager

## Auto-Updates

The userscript includes auto-update functionality. Your userscript manager will periodically check for updates and notify you when a new version is available. You can also manually check for updates in your userscript manager's dashboard.

## Setup

1. **Get a Discord Webhook URL**:
   - Go to your Discord server
   - Right-click on the channel where you want tweets posted
   - Select "Edit Channel" ‚Üí "Integrations" ‚Üí "Webhooks"
   - Click "New Webhook" or select an existing one
   - Copy the webhook URL

2. **Configure the userscript**:
   - Go to Twitter/X.com
   - Look for the Discord icon in the left navigation panel
   - Click it to open settings
   - Paste your webhook URL
   - Make sure "Enable Discord posting" is checked
   - Click "Save"

## Usage

Once configured, the userscript runs automatically:

1. Compose and post a tweet as normal
2. The userscript will detect the post
3. Your tweet will be sent to Discord with:
   - Tweet text
   - First image (if any)
   - Link to the original tweet
   - Your Twitter username and profile picture

## Discord Embed Format

The webhook creates a rich embed containing:
- **Author**: Your Twitter display name and @username
- **Description**: The tweet text
- **Image**: First image from the tweet (if applicable)
- **Link**: Direct link to view the tweet on Twitter
- **Footer**: Timestamp and Twitter icon

## Limitations

- Only the first image is shown in Discord embeds (Discord limitation)
- Videos and GIFs are not embedded (link to Twitter to view)
- Requires the Discord webhook to be publicly accessible
- May need updates if Twitter changes their internal API

## Language Settings

**Discord Timestamps**: Discord shows timestamps (like "Today at" or "Heute um") based on YOUR Discord language settings, not the script's language setting. To see timestamps in German:
1. Go to Discord User Settings ‚Üí Language
2. Select "Deutsch"
3. Restart Discord

The script's language setting only affects the embed text (footer, buttons, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

**Settings button not appearing:**
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're on twitter.com or x.com
- Check that the userscript is enabled

**Tweets not posting to Discord:**
- Verify the webhook URL is correct
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure "Enable Discord posting" is checked
- Test the webhook URL manually with a tool like curl

**"Failed to send to Discord" errors:**
- Check if the webhook URL is valid
- Ensure the webhook hasn't been deleted
- Verify Discord server permissions

## Privacy & Security

- This script only sends YOUR tweets (not others')
- Webhook URLs are stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to third parties
- All communication is directly between your browser and Discord

## Technical Details

The userscript works by:
1. Intercepting XMLHttpRequest calls to Twitter's GraphQL API
2. Detecting successful CreateTweet responses
3. Parsing the tweet data from the response
4. Formatting and sending it to Discord via webhook
